## Cookie Notice for Plus UI

This Cookie Notice explains how Plus UI ("we," "us," and "our") uses cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other similar technologies (collectively referred to as "Cookies") to recognize you when you visit our public website at https://www.plusui.com (the "Website"), and Plus UI's online software-as-a-service platform including any related APIs provided by Plus UI, together with all related mobile and desktop applications (collectively, "Services"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

Please review our [Privacy Policy] for more information about how Plus UI collects, uses, and shares your personal information.

## What are Cookies?
Cookies are small text files that are stored through the browser on your computer or mobile device (for example, Google Chrome or Safari) when you visit a website. They allow the site to store information like login information or language preference. You can think of Cookies as providing a so-called memory for the website so that it can recognize you when you come back and respond appropriately. You are not obligated to accept all Cookies to visit our website; however, enabling Cookies may allow for a more personalized browsing experience and is required for most of our Services to work.

## Cookie Duration

Cookies are either "session cookies" which are automatically deleted when you close your browser, or "persistent cookies" which will usually remain on your device until you delete them or they expire.

## Cookie Scope

Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Plus UI) are called "first party cookies." Only Plus UI can access the first party cookies we set. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies." Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and social sharing). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your browser both when you visit the website in question and also when you visit other websites that have partnered with them.

## Cookie Classification

Plus UI classifies Cookies into the following categories, and each Cookie we use on the Websites falls within one of the following categories, as detailed in our current Cookie list below.

Essential Cookies (cannot be switched off)

These are necessary for the website to work. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personal data or personally identifiable information.

## Personalization Cookies
They are only set in response to actions made by you that amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. These let the Website remember the choices you make (like dark mode, language, or region) and personalize features for you. For example, we may show you different content depending on which of our sites you've visited and the content you've read.

## Analytics Cookies

These help Plus UI understand visitor interactions, measure website performance and spot potential technical issues. These Cookies are used for analytics, research and to perform statistics (based on aggregated information).

## Marketing Cookies
These help deliver advertising that's more relevant to you. They may also be used to limit the number of times you see an ad and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. Most of the time these are third party cookies provided by our advertising partners.
